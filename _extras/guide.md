# Foundations

## Keyboard shortcuts are your friend

### Efficiency and control

# Foundations

## Plain text formats are your friend

### Computers process them better

### Platform agnostic

### Display orientated files aren't your friend

### Markdown

# Foundations

## Structuring files and folders

### Consistent and predictable data structure

### Semantic-data hybrid directory names

### Your own system is fine

### Links files and directories with names

# You are the most likely person to forget what you once did!

# Regular Expressions

### Match on types of character

### Match patterns

### Capture the parts that match your pattern

# Regular Expressions

## `organi[sz]e`

### organise (match)

### organize (match)

### reorganise (match part so will also find)

### reorganize (match part so will also find)

# Regular Expressions

### `[ABC]` matches A or B or C.

### `[A-Z]` matches any upper case letter.

### `[A-Za-z0-9]` matches any upper or lower case letter or any digit.

# Regular Expressions

### `.` matches any character at all.

### `\d` matches any single digit.

### `\w` matches any part of word character.

### `\s` matches any space, tab, or newline.

### `\b` matches a word boundary.

### `^` asserts start of the line.

### `$` asserts end of the line

# Regular Expressions

## `^\[Oo\]rgani.e\b`

# Regular Expressions

### `*` matches proceeding character any number of times including zero.

### `+` matches proceeding character any number of times excluding zero.

### `?` matches the proceeding character one or zero times.

### `{VALUE,VALUE}` matches proceeding character a defined number of times.

### `|` simply means or.

# Regular Expressions

## `^[Oo]rgani.e\w\*`

# Regular Expressions

## `[Oo]rgani.e\w+$`

# Regular Expressions

## `^[Oo]rgani.e\w?\b`

# Regular Expressions

## `^[Oo]rgani.e\w?$`

# Regular Expressions

## `\b[Oo]rgani.e\w{2}\b`

# Regular Expressions

## `\b[Oo]rgani.e\b|\b[Oo]rgani.e\w{1}\b`

# Regular Expressions

## Teams of 4

### Work through excerise

### Split into two teams and write:

#### strings that need regex

#### regex that need outputs

### Test each other!

### After the session: take the quiz!
