Open the swCoC.md file, copy it, and paste it into the test string box.

Type 'community' into the regular expression box. 

you get 6 full matches of the word "community"

Type 'community ' (with a space). You get three matches. Why not six?

The string 'community-led' matches the first search, but drops out of this result because the space does not match the character '-'. If you want to match 'community-led' by adding another regex character, what would it be? Answer: . (period)

Change the string to communi

you get 13 full matches of several words. Why?

solution:
Because the string 'communi' is present in all of those words.

Change the string to [Cc]ommuni

You get 14 matches. Why?

There is the word Community with a capital C.

Change the string to ^[Cc]ommuni. You get no matches. Why?

There is no matching string present at the start of a line.

Find all of the words starting with Comm or comm that are plural.

Answer: [Cc]omm\w+s

How would you find the email addresses, if any, in this document?

1. Start with a character you know should be in the string. In an email, there should be an "@"

2. the string before the "@" could contain any kind of word character (/w?), digit (/d?) or (|) character (./?), matching the preceding character 1 or many times:

[\w?|\d?|.?]+@

3. The same with the first part of the address:

[\w?|\d?|.?]+@[\w?|\d?|.?]+

4. And we know there will be a period, which, since it is also the symbol for a character, has to be preceded by an escape, which is the backslash:

[\w?|\d?|.?]+@[\w?|\d?|.?]+\.

5. Finally, we want to find a series of word characters (/w?) or digits (/d?) two to three characters long ({2,4})

[\w?|\d?|.?]+@[\w?|\d?|.?]+\.[\w?|\d?]{2,4}


Does this CoC provide a phone number to call?

What to consider:
1. It may or may not have a country code, perhaps starting with a "+"
2. It will have an area code, potentially enclosed in parens
3. It may have the sections all separated with a "-"

How would we write a regex to capture any of these possibilities?

Start with what we know is most likely, three digits, a dash, and four digits.

\d{1,3}-\d{1,4}

Add the potential for an area code with a dash

\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}

What if the phone number has the area code in parens with a space between it and the rest of the number.

\(?\d{3}\)?-?\d{3}-\d{4}
    \(? = opening paren that needs an escape (\) that may appear 0 or 1 time (?)
    \d{3} = 3 digits
    \)? = closing paren that needs an escape (\) that may appear 0 or 1 time (?)
    -? = a dash that may appear 0 or 1 time (?)
In this case, you have created an expression that meets both conditions: parens that may appear, and/or a dash that may appear.

But what if there is a space between the closing paren and the rest of the number?

\(?\d{3}\)?-?\s?\d{3}-\d{4}

Adding the /s? to the expression means a space may appear. The addition of this fulfills all of the conditions....

but wait! What if you want to capture the country code?

Country codes are preceded by a "+" and can have up to three digits. We also have to consider that there may or may not be a space between the country code and anything appearing next.

\+\d{1,3}\s?\(?\d{3}\)?-?\s?\d{3}-\d{4}
