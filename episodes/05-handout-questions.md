# Library Carpentry Week One: Introduction to Data

## Schedule

- Introduction (15 minutes)
- Jargon Busting (45 minutes)
- Foundations (45 minutes)
- Regular Expressions (45 minutes)
- Quiz (30 minutes)

## Regular Expressions

- `[]` define a list or range of characters to be found
- `.` matches any character at all
- `\d` matches any single digit
- `\w` matches and part of word character (equivalent to [A-Za-z0-9_] )
- `\s` matches any space, tab, or newline
- `\b` adds a word boundary
- `^` asserts the position at the start of the line. So what you put after it will only match the first characters of a line or contents of a cell.
- `$` asserts the position at the end of the line. So what you put after it will only match the last character of a line of contents of a cell.
- `*` matches when the preceding character appears any number of times including zero
- `+` matches when the preceding character appears any number of times excluding zero
- `?` matches when the preceding character appears one or zero times
- `{VALUE}` matches the preceding character the number of times define by VALUE; ranges can be specified with the syntax `{VALUE,VALUE}`
- `|` simply means or
