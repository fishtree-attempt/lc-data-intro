### Task

**SLIDE**

This group task is an opportunity for you to get help understanding terms, phrases, or ideas around code or software development that you've come across and perhaps feel you should know better.

- Start by getting into groups of 4 or 5.
- Next make a big list of all the problem terms, phrases, and ideas that come up. Retain duplicates. Then (taking common words as a starting point) work together to try to explain what a term, phrase, or idea means (note: use both each other and the internet as a resource!). Make a note of those your group resolves and those you are still struggling with. **15 minutes**
- **Trainer note**: alongside this make a note of common problem terms, phrases, and ideas that both do and do not map to what Library Carpentry will cover (paying special attention to common problems that will not be covered)
- Report back on an issue resolved by your group **1 minute each**
- **Trainer note**: Report on mapping exercise: what is and isn't going to be covered.
